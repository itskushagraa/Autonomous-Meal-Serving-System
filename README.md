# Autonomous-Meal-Serving-System
 An affordable robotic meal serving system that is scalable, mass-manufacturable, and can carry an efficient load.
 
 The robot can carry up to 60 (15 kg per tray, 4 trays) of dishes. Stress analysis calculations are included in the repository.
 
● Lid Mechanism added to tray edges to ensure dishes do not slide off the tray while the robot is in motion

● Minimum size of serving tray on robot (top tray): 12”x16” or 30cm x 40cm.

● Includes enclosures for the motor, battery, and mechanisms used to fasten them in place.

● Assembly weight: 32.67kg

● Build Cost: $1900

● The robot is mobile and follows a modular design.

● Includes a collision detection mechanism of 6 Ultrasonic Sensors (validated within the mechanical design). 

● Ease of charging and storage when not in use.

● Ease of assembly and maintenance.

● Material Selection: Polylactic Acid (PLA) - minimal to no carbon footprint.

● Creative freedom is given for the design of the robot
